Form task
--------------------------------------------------
I guess that this task is part of a real project, where it would be possible to add new delivery methods, as well as change their names. 
However, I have done what is written in the task description and in accordance with the attached image. 
So the emphasis is on the form and updating existing methods which are already in the database. 
I've done the task using PHP/MySQL, CSS, Bootstrap framework and jQuery library.

To create a database "deliveries" (there are two tables: delivery_method and delivery_ranges), please use "deliveries.sql" file.

There are 5 delivery methods, covering a variety of options planned in the task (some input fields are filled in and some are empty):
1. method - has it's price
2. method - ranges (4 range rows)
3. method - ranges (2 range rows)
4. method - have no value (unavailable)
5. method - value as zero (free)

Database parameters are in /class/DeliveryMethods.php file.

Of course, the main file with the form is index.php in root folder and there are located 3 images in order to demonstrate the form layout.
